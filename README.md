# Terminator Layouts

### Notes:
* Righth click on any terminator terminal >> preferences >> Layouts


* ```save``` button is only to add current open terminator terminal layouts/configs to selected layout.
* **DO NOT** press ```save``` after typing in or chaning commands in the text box. 
That will modify the layout to whatever is open currently and clear all the commands that were previously stored


* Ensure all commands end with the ```bash``` command
* Saved config can be found at: ```~/.config/terminator/config```


* Open **regular** terminal and run ```terminator -l layout_name```
